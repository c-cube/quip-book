# Introduction

Welcome to the Quip documentation. Quip ("Quick Proofs") is an experimental
proof format for first-order and higher-order automatic theorem provers,
designed to be easy to produce, and reasonably easy to check.

There are two sides to this documentation:

- the point of view of theorem provers, SMT solvers, etc.
  that might _produce_ Quip proofs;
- the point of view of proof checkers that aim at validating such proofs.

**NOTE**: the proof format is experimental and its design will most likely
fluctuate a lot for a while, as checkers and proof-producing provers are
developed.
